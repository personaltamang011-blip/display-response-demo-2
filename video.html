            <p>Friday, December 12 (Mangsir 26) “For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, and your steadfast love is
                abundant toward all who call upon you.” – Psalm 86:5 Prayer for Deliverance from Guilt “Heavenly Father,
                I have repented and am truly sorry for my actions, but the guilt of my sin continues to haunt me. Now
                the burden has become too heavy for me to bear. So I turn to you for deliverance. Your Word declares
                that you are ready to forgive me (see Nehemiah 9:17) and that you have abundant mercy for all who call
                upon you (see Isaiah 55:7). The problem is that I find it difficult to accept your forgiveness and to
                free myself from the guilt of my sin. Help me to understand and receive your promise that says, ‘If we
                confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
                unrighteousness’ (1 John 1:9). You have said in your Word, ‘I, even I, am he who blots out your
                transgressions for my own sake, and I will remember your sins no more’ (Isaiah 43:25). Your Strengthened
                by the Spirit, I no longer want to let thoughts of guilt and condemnation rob me of the peace and joy
                You have given me. I stand on Your Word, which says, ‘As far as the east is from the west, so far have
                You removed my transgressions from me’ (see Psalm 103:12). You have said, ‘Their sins and their
                iniquities I will remember no more’ (Hebrews 10:17). Since You do not want to remember it, help me to
                forget it and to stop repeating it over and over again. From today on, I declare, ‘The blood of Jesus
                Christ, God’s Son, cleanses me from all sin’ (see 1 John 1:7). If you feel guilty, call on God, who is
                able to cleanse you from all sin. Spiritual Food: Micah 5–7 John 19:31–42 Psalm 105:23–36 Proverbs
                30:15–19
